<p>
I am a Ph.D. student at the CS@UCLA. Previously I was a Ph.D. student at the CS@UVA from August 2015 to August 2017. In fall 2017, I moved to UCLA with my advisor Dr. Kai-Wei Chang. My research focus spans the areas of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. My research goal is to develop computational algorithms that (1) reduce the amount of labeled data required to train NLP models from scratch; and (2) adapt to new domains and languages with fewer labeled examples.

I have received my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from the CSE@BUET, in February 2013 and Master of Computer Science from the CS@UVA, in August 2017. In my free time, I like to solve programming problems to improve my skill and also contribute to the community. I have given 400+ answers of programming related questions and earned 15,000+ reputation on StackOverflow.
